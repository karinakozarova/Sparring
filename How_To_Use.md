<li> Click on View Code <a href= "http://imgur.com/a/FnzcO"> </a> </li>
<li> Download the Sparring_score.html file <a href= "http://imgur.com/a/jdYps"> </a> </li>

<h2> Step 2 </h2>
Open it with a browser (Chrome, Opera, Safari, etc).
<blockquote> Don't open it with a file editor (Notepad,HTML viewer,Google Docs,etc) because this will only show you the code,but won't run it. </blockquote> Your screen should look like this:

<h2> Step 3 </h2>
<h4>This step is all about using the app. </h4> 
When you want to start the timer, simply click where you see 1:00.
When you click it,the timer will start counting down until it reaches to 0:00. You have exactly one minute to write the scores. 

<blockquote> NB! The scores here are simplified. When competing not all kicks are scored, there are some rules which you can find <a href = "https://github.com/karinakozarova/Sparring/blob/master/ITF_TKD_Rules.md"> here </a> </blockquote>

For example if player1 hits player2 with hands, you should click the left +1 button. If player1 kicks player2 in the head, you should click the left +3 button. If player1 kicks player2 at the body - click the left +2 button.
